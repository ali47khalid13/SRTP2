This particular cell is a `Markdown` cell. You can execute a particular cell by double clicking on it (the highlight color will switch from blue to green) and pressing `Shift-Enter`. When you do so, if the cell is a `Code` cell, the code in the cell will run, and the output of the cell will be displayed beneath the cell, and if the cell is a `Markdown` cell, the markdown text will get rendered beneath the cell.\n",

Escaping a `Markdown` cell won't render it, so make sure to execute it if you wish to render the markdown. Notice how the highlight color switches back to blue when you have escaped a cell.\n",
