# Installing pip 

## what is pip? 
pip is a package manager for Python. That means it’s a tool that allows you to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies that are not distributed as part of the standard library. Package management is so important that pip has been included with the Python installer since versions 3.4 for Python 3 and 2.7.9 for Python 2, and it’s used by many Python projects, which makes it an essential tool for every Pythonista.

The concept of a package manager might be familiar to you if you are coming from other languages. JavaScript uses npm for package management, Ruby uses gem, and .NET use NuGet. In Python, pip has become the standard package manager.
